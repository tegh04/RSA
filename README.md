# RSA

This code is an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm. The RSA encryption algorithm is the worlds first public-key encryption algorithm. 
This was revolutionary as it allowed secure communication over the Internet.  

The key function required for the RSA implemented:

-Euclidean algorithm
-Extended Euclidean algorithm
-Square root technique for finding prime numbers
-Modulo exponentiation by squaring

The encryption process works by using the public key to encrypt some text into a string of numbers. This encryption process is reversed with the use of the private key, which is kept secret.
